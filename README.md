# Processing-Projects

Compilation of small codes that can be executed using the processing 4.0 IDE.

They are all small in their essence, but help visualize some fun concepts from different areas.

The repo will keep increasing as I find free time to do more of these things.


List of codes:

  - Double Pendulum:
    
      Visualizer for the chaotic movement of a doube pundulum, where small changes in the initial conditions lead to very different trajectories.
      Animates 100 pendulums of different colors simultaneously, with small differences in initial position, creating a visualy interesting video
    
  - Lotka-Volterra equations:
    
      Visualizer of the Lotka-Volterra equations for predator-prey relation
      In nature, when a predator increases in population, its prey dimineshes. When that happens, the predator has little food so its population decreases, leading to an increase in prey population due to lack of predators. 
      This allows the predator's numbers to rise, leading to a cycle.
      The Lotka-Volterra equations predict in a simplistic way the balance between the predator/prey population through time
      This code plots, for many initial conditions, the time evolution of prey/predator populations by having several points moving such that the x position of the point is the prey population and the y position is the predator population.
      This allows to see the cycle of majoraty of predators that leads to a majoraty of prey and vice-versa in an endless loop.
     
  - Aizawa Atractor:
  
      Visualizer for the aizawa atractor.
      An atractor is a system of differential equations where a point tends to allways go to a specific path, independent of its original coordinates (as long as its not too far from the center of the atractor).
      The Aizawa atractor is an example of this type of equations, that leads to an object that looks like a sphere with a wormhole in the middle
