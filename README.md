# Processing-Projects

Compilation of small codes that can be executed using the processing 4.0 IDE.

They are all small in their essence, but help visualize some fun concepts from different areas.

The repo will keep increasing as I find free time to do more of these things.


List of codes:

  - Double Pendulum
  - Lotka-Volterra equations
  - Aizawa Atractor
